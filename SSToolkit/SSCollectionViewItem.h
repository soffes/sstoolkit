 assigned to the item object in `initWithFrame:reuseIdentifier:` and cannot be changed thereafter. A `SSCollectionView`

 available to the delegate in the `dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:` method.

 state to `YES` through this property, the transition to the new state appearance is not animated. For animated
 highlighted-state transitions, see the `setHighlighted:animated:` method.

 `detailTextLabel` properties and set each label's `highlightedTextColor` property; for images, get the item's image
 using the `imageView` property and set the `UIImageView` object's `highlightedImage` property.
