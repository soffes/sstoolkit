/**
 A simple wrapper for concurrent NSOperations

 Subclasses should override the start and stop methods. Here is a basic example.

 <pre><code>- (void)start {
     [super start];
     networkRequest = [[NetworkRequest alloc] init];
     [networkRequest start];
 }

 - (void)finish {
     [networkRequest cancel];
     [networkRequest release];
     [super finish];
 }</code></pre>

 This allows for convenient handling of asynchronous calls in an operation.

/**
 Finishes the receiver's task.

 Subclasses must implement their own versions of `finish` to clean up anything before the operation completes. After
 performing the class-specific functionality, the subclass method should incorporate superclass versions of `finish`
 through a message to `super`.
