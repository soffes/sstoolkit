 Aggregates calls to settings `networkActivityIndicatorVisible` to avoid flashing of the indicator in the status bar.
 Simply use `setNetworkActivity:` instead of `setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:`.

 Specify `YES` if the application should show network activity and `NO` if it should not. The default value is `NO`.
 A spinning indicator in the status bar shows network activity. The application may explicitly hide or show this
 indicator.
