 This class is a work in progress.

 The `SSAnimatedImageViewDelegate` protocol defines methods that a delegate of a `SSAnimatedImageView` object can
 optionally implement to observe the animation status.

 @warning **Important:** Before releasing an instance of `SSAnimatedImageView` for which you have set a delegate, you
 must first set the `SSAnimatedImageView` delegate property to `nil` before disposing of the `SSAnimatedImageView`
 instance. This can be done, for example, in the `dealloc` method where you dispose of the `SSAnimatedImageView`.
