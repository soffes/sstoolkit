 Executes the given block. If the block has been executed in less time than the limit, it will not be executed.
 
 @param block The block to be executed. This should not be `nil`.
 
 @param name A string identifying the block. If more than one block have the same name, their last executed time will be
 stored together.
 
 @param limit The time interval (in seconds). This should be a positive, non-zero value.
 
 @return `YES` if the block was executed. `NO` if it was not.
 
 The time will not be persisted across application launches (for now). The block is synchronously executed on the same
 thread that called this method and not in a GCD queue. If you need to dispatch, simply do that in the block you
 provide.
