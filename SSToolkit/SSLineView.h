 Don't under estimate this class. It draws lines, but they are awesome.

 The recommended height is `2.0` points if you are using the inset and `1.0` if you are not.

 The inset is drawn under the line if `insetColor` is not `nil`.

 A float that specifies how far into the dash pattern the line starts, in points.

 For example, passing a value of 3 means the line is drawn with the dash pattern starting at 3 points from its
 beginning. Passing a value of 0 draws a line starting with the beginning of a dash pattern.

 The default is `0.0`.

 segment and a 3 point long unpainted segment. Passing the values [1,3,4,2] sets the pattern to a 1 point painted
 segment, a 3 point unpainted segment, a 4 oiunt painted segment, and a 2 point unpainted segment.

 The default is `nil`.
