 This class pushes UIWebView to its limits and many common and usually difficult tasks very simple.

 Note that this class doesn't actually inherit from UIWebView, but instead forwards all of UIWebView's public methods to
 an internal instance. It has been designed to be a drop in replacement for UIWebView.

 Things of interest are the SSWebView properties and the extra `delegate` methods.
