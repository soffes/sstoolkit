# SSToolkit

SSToolkit was a grab bag of iOS goodies. It was a giant collection of classes that I started in 2008. This was getting out of hand. **That version is completely deprecated.** ([Read more on that](https://github.com/soffes/sstoolkit/issues/189).)

Now SSToolkit is made up of several libraries you can use independently. SSToolkit is now just a header file and a [podspec](https://cocoapods.org/) with dependencies for each library. I don't recommend using the `SSToolkit` pod.

Here’s what’s included:

* [SAMAddressBar](https://github.com/soffes/SAMAddressBar) — Clone of Safari's address bar from iOS 6.
* [SAMBadgeView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMBadgeView) — Simple badge view.
* [SAMGradientView](https://github.com/soffes/GradientView) — Easy gradients in UIKit.
* [SAMHUDView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMHUDView) — Kinda okay HUD.
* [SAMLabel](https://github.com/soffes/SAMLabel) — UILabel with vertical alignment and text insets.
* [SAMLoadingView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMLoadingView) — Simple loading view.
* [SAMCircleProgressView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMCircleProgressView) — Determinate, circular progress view.
* [SAMRateLimit](https://github.com/soffes/RateLimit) — Simple utility for only executing code every so often.
* [SAMTextField](https://github.com/soffes/SAMTextField) — Handy UITextField additions like insetting text.
* [SAMTextView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMTextView) — Add a placeholder to UITextView.
* [SAMWebView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMWebView) — Push UIWebView to its limits.
* [SAMCategories](https://github.com/soffes/SAMCategories) — A collection of useful Foundation and UIKit categories.

Several of these libraries have had big improvements since their abstraction from SSToolkit.
