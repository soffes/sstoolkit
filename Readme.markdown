# SSToolkit

SSToolkit makes life easier. It is made up of various view controllers, views, and categories that I use in all of my apps. Feel free to fork the repo and make it better.

If you're using this in your project, I'd love to hear about it! [Send me an email](mailto:sam@samsoff.es) and let me know which pieces you're using and such.

## Documentation

**Read the [SSToolkit Documentation](http://sstoolk.it/documentation) online.**

Install the documentation into Xcode with the following steps:

1. Open Xcode Preferences
2. Choose Downloads
3. Choose the Documentation tab
4. Click the plus button in the bottom right and enter the following URL:
    
        http://docs.sstoolk.it/com.samsoffes.sstoolkit.atom

5. Click Install next the new row reading "SSToolkit Documentation". (If you don't see it and didn't get an error, try restarting Xcode.)

Be sure you have the docset selected in the organizer to see results for SSToolkit.
